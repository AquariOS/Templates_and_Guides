                                     THREAD TEMPLATE DOES NOT START HERE!!! 

                                      MAKE SURE YOU READ AND FOLLOW THIS!

                                      PLEASE BE AWARE OF THE FOLLOWING:

1. FIND THE 7 ENTRIES BELOW MARKED WITH "<<<<<" AND MAKE THE APPROPRIATE CHANGES TO THE MARKED LINE.

2. REMOVE THE "<<<<<" FROM YOUR COPY AFTER YOUR EDITING IS COMPLETED.

3. LOOK THROUGH THE FEATURES LISTS AND MAKE SURE YOUR DEVICE IS COMPATIBLE WITH ALL ITEMS - REMOVE ANYTHING THAT ISN'T

4. BE SURE TO INCLUDE "[UNOFFICIAL]" IN YOUR THREAD TITLE, UNLESS PERMITTED OTHERWISE!

5. PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR THREAD AND USER COMMENTS :)

6. YOU SHOULD START COPYING TO CLIPBOARD AT LINE #40 IN THIS DOCUMENT AND END AT LINE #243


SETTING UP THREAD:

7. COPY/PASTE THIS INTO THE "PROJECT NAME" FIELD:

				AquariOS 9

8. COPY/PASTE THIS INTO THE "THREAD TITLE" FIELD IN THE XDA THREAD PROJECT EDITOR PAGE: 

        ***ONLY post ROM as "OFFICIAL" if given direct permission by @calebcabob or @rc420head, otherwise use "UNOFFICIAL"

				[ROM][OFFICIAL] AquariOS 9 || Live Support || VoLTE/WFC* || Theming || <date>

   A) The "*" next to WFC is so you can specify in your thread which carriers have been reported to NOT have WiFi Calling working
   B) Obviously change the date in the ROM thread title to reflect the date of your latest build

9. DON'T FORGET TO CHANGE THE "PROJECT FORUM" TO THE ROM SECTION - OR YOUR THREAD WILL END UP IN THE DEFAULT GENERAL SECTION!

10. ADD calebcabob AND rc420head INTO THE FIRST 2 CONTRIBUTOR FIELDS.

[SIZE="3"]We are [B]NOT[/B] responsible for anything that may happen to your device as a result of flashing ROMs, kernels, or installing any other mod. You are responsible for your own actions and bad decisions - so stop blaming others! ;)

This is a user friendly thread. Please be respectful and courteous to other users. While feature requests will be considered, AquariOS tries to maintain a ROM that is smooth and stable, so adding every feature under the sun is not the plan here.[/SIZE]

[SIZE="3"]1. Unless I tell you otherwise, you [B][I]MUST[/I][/B] always, absolutely, positively, most certainly [COLOR="#cc5012"][B]wipe data AND system[/B][/COLOR] before flashing AquariOS...without a doubt!

2. Don't report bugs if you haven't followed directions - most likely it's user error at that point as far as I'm concerned.

3. Always run a backup before doing anything.

4. Provide a log when reporting a bug (see more info below).

5. Be respectful.

Read this before telling everyone something is broken!
[HIDE]
[B]1. Android Pay isn't working!! What do I do?[/B]
[I]Go into Magisk settings and toggle on the "Hide Magisk" option. Then try again. Also, I've found once in a great while, even with this enabled, it will say it failed - if this happens, just try again...it'll work.[/I]

[B]2. It's bootlooping after flashing ROM with Magisk - now what?[/B]
[I]Don't flash Magisk until you have already booted into the new AquariOS build at least once. If that wasn't your issue, sometimes Substratum overlays can cause bootloops. If you have anything applied, flash the SubstratumRescue zip from your substratum directory[/I]

[B]3. Why is the built-in System Theme section greyed-out (background, accent, & fonts)? [/B]
[I]When the Substratum app is installed, this section will become inaccessible in order to prevent conflicts. You CANNOT use them both at once![/I]
[/HIDE]

[B][SIZE="5"][FONT="Trebuchet MS"][COLOR="#0d90c4"]Reporting a bug?[/COLOR][/FONT][/SIZE][/B]
See how to do so here:
[HIDE]
[B]BEFORE REPORTING A BUG:[/B]
1. Flash the SubstratumRescue zip and see if your issue is still there.
2. If you have flashed a custom kernel or ANY OTHER MODs, delete 'data/system/packages_cache' then wipe dalvik/cache, and flash AquariOS again WITHOUT any additional modifications/custom kernel.
3. Check to see if your issue persists.

*Do NOT even bother reporting an issue if you have dirty-flashed AquariOS over some other ROM! We WILL be able to tell!

Logs are crucial to resolving almost any kind of issue. You need to provide a log in order for the issue to be addressed. Please also include info on how to reproduce the reported bug if possible (maybe even take a screen recording for us ;)).

If you need a log extracting app, try out [URL="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nolanlawson.logcat&hl=en"]CatLog[/URL]!
Either save your log locally and share it, or paste your log into an online code sharing tool like [URL="http://hastebin.com"]hastebin.com[/URL] - then share the URL after hitting the SAVE icon. [/HIDE]
