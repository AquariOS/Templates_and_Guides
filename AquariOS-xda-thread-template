                                      PLEASE BE AWARE OF THE FOLLOWING:

SETTING UP THREAD:

				[ROM][OFFICIAL] AquariOS 8.1.0 || Live Support || VoLTE/WFC* || Theming - MARCH 23

[SIZE="3"]We are [B]NOT[/B] responsible for anything that may happen to your device as a result of flashing ROMs, kernels, or installing any other mod. You are responsible for your own actions and bad decisions - so stop blaming others! ;)

This is a user friendly thread. Please be respectful and courteous to other users. While feature requests will be considered, AquariOS tries to maintain a ROM that is smooth and stable, so adding every feature under the sun is not the plan here.[/SIZE]


[INDENT][SIZE="7"][COLOR="#0d90c4"][B][CENTER]READ![/CENTER][/B][/COLOR][/SIZE]
[SIZE="3"]1. Unless I tell you otherwise, you [B][I]MUST[/I][/B] always, absolutely, positively, most certainly [COLOR="#cc5012"][B]wipe data AND system[/B][/COLOR] before flashing AquariOS...without a doubt!

2. Don't report bugs if you haven't followed directions - most likely it's user error at that point as far as I'm concerned.

3. Always run a backup before doing anything.

4. Provide a log when reporting a bug (see more info below).

5. Be respectful.

[B][SIZE="5"][FONT="Trebuchet MS"][COLOR="#0d90c4"]Q & A[/COLOR][/FONT][/SIZE][/B]
Read this before telling everyone something is broken!
[HIDE]
[B]1. Android Pay isn't working!! What do I do?[/B]
[I]Go into Magisk settings and toggle on the "Hide Magisk" option. Then try again. Also, I've found once in a great while, even with this enabled, it will say it failed - if this happens, just try again...it'll work.[/I]

[B]2. It's bootlooping after flashing ROM with Magisk - now what?[/B]
[I]Don't flash Magisk until you have already booted into the new AquariOS build at least once. If that wasn't your issue, sometimes Substratum overlays can cause bootloops. If you have anything applied, flash the SubstratumRescue zip from your substratum directory[/I]

[B]3. Why is the built-in System Theme section greyed-out (background, accent, & fonts)? [/B]
[I]When the Substratum app is installed, this section will become inaccessible in order to prevent conflicts. You CANNOT use them both at once![/I]
[/HIDE]

[B][SIZE="5"][FONT="Trebuchet MS"][COLOR="#0d90c4"]Reporting a bug?[/COLOR][/FONT][/SIZE][/B]
See how to do so here:
[HIDE]
[B]BEFORE REPORTING A BUG:[/B]
1. Flash the SubstratumRescue zip and see if your issue is still there.
2. If you have flashed a custom kernel or ANY OTHER MODs, delete 'data/system/packages_cache' then wipe dalvik/cache, and flash AquariOS again WITHOUT any additional modifications/custom kernel.
3. Check to see if your issue persists.

*Do NOT even bother reporting an issue if you have dirty-flashed AquariOS over some other ROM! We WILL be able to tell!

Logs are crucial to resolving almost any kind of issue. You need to provide a log in order for the issue to be addressed. Please also include info on how to reproduce the reported bug if possible (maybe even take a screen recording for us ;)).

If you need a log extracting app, try out [URL="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nolanlawson.logcat&hl=en"]CatLog[/URL]!
Either save your log locally and share it, or paste your log into an online code sharing tool like [URL="http://hastebin.com"]hastebin.com[/URL] - then share the URL after hitting the SAVE icon. [/HIDE]
